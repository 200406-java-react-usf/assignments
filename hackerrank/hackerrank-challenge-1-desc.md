# HackerRank Challenge

[HackerRank]() is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.

As we continue forward with the training, we will start learning more about advanced frameworks. Even when we begin working with Java, we will quickly move from the core language to advanced frameworks. While these frameworks will definitely help us to create easily configurable full stack web applications very quickly, the abstraction that they provide will cause us to move further away from that "pure" kind of problem solving, where you are just solving problem using nothing but a programming language and its native libraries.

The challenges presented on HackerRank are sometimes quite challenging, but it is important to our basic problem solving skills sharp. Many of Revature's clients have candidates complete some basic coding challenges as a part of their hiring process. The projects that you will build throughout training will undoubtly help you during a challenge that requires you to build an simple API on the spot. However, those skills do not necessarily translate into an ability to solve the kinds of programming challenges you will find on websites like HackerRank (e.g [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/), [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/)). I recommend trying out all of these websites, to give yourself a wide range of different problem sets to practice with.

You will be completing HackerRank challenges on a frequent basis, for the afforementioned reasons. I have created a HackerRank content which is meant to introduce you the the HackerRank platform, while also assessing your problem solving abilities using JavaScript (you technically can choose whatever language you want, but please use JavaScript since that is our focus). The questions are sometimes wordy and loaded with jargon (as is common for these kinds of challenges), do your best to understand the problem thoroughly before beginning to work on your solution.
