    12.)Create a function which takes a 3x3 2-dimensional array. Validate that each array index holds only a value of “X”, “O”, or an empty string. Have the function evaluate a game of tic tac toe represented by the 2D array.  Should have a result for a tie, each winner, or an invalid game.

        tictactoe([[‘X’, ‘X’, ‘X’], [‘O’, ‘O’, ‘O’], [‘X’, ‘O’, ‘X’]]) 
        prints “Invalid result”

        tictactoe([[‘X’, ‘O’, ‘X’] ,[‘O’, ‘X’, ‘O’], [‘X’, ‘O’, ‘X’]])
        Prints “X is the winner”

        tictactoe([[‘’, ‘O’, ‘X’] , [‘X’, ‘O’, ‘’], [‘‘, ‘O’, ‘X’]]) 
        Prints “O is the winner”

            tictactoe([[‘X’, ‘’, ‘X’], [‘O’, ‘’, ‘’], [‘’, ‘O’, ‘’]]) 
        Prints “Game in progress, no winner yet”
